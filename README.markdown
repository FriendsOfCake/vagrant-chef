# Vagrant Chef for CakePHP [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FriendsOfCake/vagrant-chef.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/FriendsOfCake/vagrant-chef)


Vagrant Chef creates a Vagrant installation for CakePHP using Chef with the following features:

- Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin
- Ningx 1.6
- PHP 5.5
- Ruby 1.9.3
- Percona MySQL 5.5
- Postgres 9.1
- Redis 2.8
- Memcached 1.4
- Git 2.0
- Composer
- The ruby gems `heroku`, `hub`, `travis` and `travis-lint`

## Requirements

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Tested on 4.3.x, but 4.2.x should also work.
- [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html). Tested on 1.4.1
- Patience, and about an hour or so of your time
- A fairly fast internet connection. Dial-up will take 3 days to get everything going ;)

## Installation

Download and install both VirtualBox and Vagrant for your particular operating system. Should only take a few minutes on a DSL connection

Once those are installed, open up a terminal in your project folder. If you want to start from scratch, create a folder and `cd` into it.

Then run this command in your project root to add `vagrant-chef`'s files into your project:

```bash
wget https://github.com/FriendsOfCake/vagrant-chef/archive/master.tar.gz -O - | tar -xz --strip-components 1
```

To set up and run a virtual machine, simply run:

```bash
vagrant up
```

It may take a bit to download the Vagrant box, but once that is done, you will be prompted for your laptop password. This is so we can properly expose the IP of the vagrant instance to your machine. Type in your password and let it continue running.

You can grab a coffee or go out for a beer at this point. Takes about half an hour to an hour, depending upon your internet connection and laptop resources.

Of note is that typing `vagrant ssh` while your vagrant instance is up will ssh onto the instance so you can perform commands directly on it. For example, it might be useful to manually install some service, or run a script within the repository.

Once it is done, browse to `http://192.168.13.37/` in your browser, and you should have some sort of `It works!` page! At this point you can set your virtualhosts to point at the instance for maximum win.

#### Custom Domain Name

If you want to access the site using a custom domain name, edit your `/etc/hosts` file to have the following line:

    192.168.13.37 www.app.dev app.dev

If you are the root user on your box, you can do something like:

```bash
echo "192.168.13.37 www.app.dev app.dev" >> "/etc/hosts"
```

#### Database Access

MySQL is available at `0.0.0.0:3306` with either of the following credentials:

- `root:bananas`
- `user:password`

#### Developing your application

Your project's root folder will appear in the virtual machine under `/vagrant`.

We suggest that you store your app's code under the `app` directory in your project's root.

    project-root/
    └ vagrant/
      └ app/
        ├ app/
        │ ├ Config
        │ ├ Console
        │ ├ Controller
        │ ├ Lib
        │ ├ Model
        │ ├ Plugin
        │ ├ tmp
        │ ├ vendor
        │ ├ View
        │ └ webroot
        ├ lib/
        ├ Plugin/
        └ vendor/

Note the double `app/app/`.

Anything in `app/app/webroot/index.php` will be served up, and all other `index.php` files ignored.

Note, we recommend using the [FriendsOfCake/app-template](https://github.com/FriendsOfCake/app-template) for new applications.

## Starting/Stopping Work

You normally wont want to have the instance running full time. To pause it, simply perform the following in the command line:

```bash
cd ~/Sites/my-project
vagrant suspend
```

You will no longer be able to access the instance after doing this. To continue working, issue the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/Sites/my-project
vagrant resume
```

## Updating Vagrant

Running `vagrant provision` will reprovision the instance. You won't normally need to do the things in the **Installation** section, but this will ensure your setup is as up-to-date as possible.

If there are any updates to the vagrant setup, such as a new feature, new site hosted within, or new service, simply do the following in a terminal:

```bash
cd ~/Sites/my-project
git pull origin master
vagrant reload --provision
```

## Starting fresh

We're sad to see you leave your work behind, but getting a fresh start isn't hard. Simply do the following:

```bash
cd ~/Sites/my-project
vagrant destroy
cd ..
rm -rf vagrant-chef
```

This will destroy your vagrant installation and remove all traces of it from your laptop.

## Bugs?

File a github issue.

## Todo

- Add phpmyadmin to setup
